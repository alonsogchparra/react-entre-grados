# Entre Grados Higado Ahogado (Hangman Game)
<img src="./src/media/images/entre_grados.png" width="100%" />

This is a Hangman game, built for a web show on Youtube called [Entre Grados](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbtAAKfp11tWhTjEcrvyAQ). The rules are the same as the typical Hangman game, you have 6 opportunities to find out the word or phrase of the game.

I have to make a special mention for this project. I based this game following the original project by [Simonjsuh](https://github.com/simonjsuh/Reactjs-Hangman-Game-Source-Code) . I took the concept and updated it to make able play it, not just with only with one word, you can add a sentence (it means you can add more the 2 words) on a game.

Besides to work with the sentences in a better way. I followed the [Marcelo Ribeiro](https://gist.github.com/marcelo-ribeiro/abd651b889e4a20e0bab558a05d38d77) way to remove accents, that helped me to move forward with this project.

Thank you very much for these contributions on programming!

Also the project has a regex that won't let start the game until you write the word or sentence well (it means only letters are allowed).

If you loose on the game, you can start a new party adding another word or phrase to keep playing.
